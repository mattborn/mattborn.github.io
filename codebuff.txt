i just started two new projects in /mattborn.com and /nothing. i want to borrow code and patterns from my websuite project to help with the cold start problem of building a new section of content for a site. can you review /webrulez and especially the code and patterns in /webrulez/websuite to execute step 1 for nothing which is just the layout.html that includes basic page markup. i also want to leverage the build pattern from /aspec-static. so nothing will be the playbook and example while mattborn.com will be the first site that implements its patterns.
