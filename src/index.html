  <h2>A little about me</h2>
  <p>
    I’m a product designer, web developer, and entrepreneur now based in Salt
    Lake City and originally Chicagoland. I build at the intersection of design,
    technology, and business. I love turning ideas into real, usable
    experiences, especially when it’s about making life smoother for families
    and founders.
  </p>

  <p>
    I read a lot. Fantasy football every year. Trying to get a 1984 Kawasaki
    KLR650 running again. My wife Megan is an insanely talented creative and
    interior designer. We are homeschooling three very active little women.
    Well, she is.
  </p>

  <p>
    My passion is taking ideas from zero to one. That could mean designing and
    building a product, prototyping a new venture, or shaping a messy idea into
    something usable. I’m happiest when I’m experimenting — whether it’s UX/UI
    design, agentic software, or making a system more human.

  <h2>What I’m working on</h2>
  <p>
    I’ve been working on the web as long as working on the web has been a thing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Right now I’m spending most of my time on
    <a href="https://llmmask.com" target="_blank">Mask</a> and
    <a href="/mitt">Mitt</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Four exits as a founding member and/or lead product designer of B2B SaaS
    company including a multi-billion-dollar IPO and $500M+ in acquisitions.
    <span class="ghost">
      Finance, Healthcare, Manufacturing, and Marketing
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve led 600+ design workshops with companies of all sizes including many
    Fortune 500 companies often with direct executive engagement.
    <span class="ghost">
      Allstate, Amazon, Apple, Boeing, DoorDash, Facebook, GE, Google, Home
      Depot, IBM, Louis Vuitton, Marsh & McLennan, Motorola, Nike, and
      UnitedHealth.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    Since 2021, I have helped 9 startups reach their fundraising goal within
    months. In the past 2 years, I helped 7 solopreneurs leave full-time roles
    and reach sustainable, six-figure ARR within weeks. Every month, I help at
    least one solopreneur or small startup launch their website within days.

  <h2>Design philosophy as a series of mantras</h2>
  <p>
    Good design is as little design as possible. —<a

  <p>
    Use the best tool for the job.
    <span class="ghost">
      Avoid typical consulting-isms: statements of work inherently undermine
      users and their needs while over-indexing on feasibility of known work.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    Learn together (twice) weekly.
    <span class="ghost">
      Avoid broad assumptions around what has yet to be observed and learned.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    Describing something means you aren’t working on it.
    <span class="ghost">
      Tom Chi encourages we consider the absurdity of debating the nature of the
      uninvented invention.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    Deliver something testable and relevant every day that proves who you are
    solving for and which of their problems might be addressable.
  </p>
  <p>
    Be SMART: specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.
    <span class="ghost">Not DUMB: doesn’t utilize meaningful benchmarks.</span>

    NIHITO: Nothing interesting happens in the office.
    <span class="ghost">
      Like surgeons do surgery, office workers do office work. Losing 50–70% of
      our work time to admin proves teams lack the self-awarness to engage with
      external human-centered work. How many weeks or months has it been since
      you tested a new experience with a qualified tester? Those who remind
      themselves of this critical resource offer a great advantage to their
      teams. No need to starve.

  <h2>Dream a little dream</h2>
  <p>My biggest dream in life is to get off computers altogether.</p>
  <p>
    I still want to leverage compute, but only through natural interfaces: being
    fully present and self expressed in conversation while compute and AI run
    quietly in the background via wearables or intermittent physical interfaces.
    We all need freedom from the endless clicking and tapping.
  </p>
  <p>
    Can we leverage technology while wandering back into the behavior patterns
    we had before personal computers?
  </p>
  <p>Only one way to <span class="ghost">fool around and</span> find out.</p>
