The cold start takes so much energy.

For many years have I been trying to ease the cold start.

The promise of relief in the age of agentics goes unfulfilled.

This site only needs to answer one basic question: **What is Matt up to?**

## Nothing

De nada!

The you-are-welcome sentiment is a great gift my today self can give to my tomorrow self.

To make it easier to go from nothing to something.

Now wouldnâ€™t that be something?
